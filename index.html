    <em><strong>COLD WAR'S GREATEST ENCRYPTION MACHINE. NEVER BROKEN.</strong></em>
  </P>
  <p>
    Like many machines of the era it used an electromechanical system of rotors to encipher messages, but with a number of security improvements over
    previous designs.<br />
    No successful cryptanalysis of the machine during its service lifetime is publicly known.
    <strong> <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/sigaba/index.htm">This is also a big part in the history of cryptography</a></strong><br />

  <h3>
    The SIGABA had three banks of five rotors each; the action of two of the banks controlled the stepping of the third.
  </h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The main bank of five rotors was termed the cipher rotors (Army) or alphabet maze (Navy) and each rotor had 26 contacts. This assembly acted similarly to other rotor machines, such as the Enigma; when a plaintext letter was entered, a signal
      would enter one side of the bank and exit the other, denoting the ciphertext letter. Unlike the Enigma, there was no reflector.

    </li>
    <li>
      The second bank of five rotors was termed the control rotors or stepping maze. These were also 26-contact rotors. The control rotors received four signals at each step. After passing through the control rotors, the outputs were divided into ten
      groups of various sizes, ranging from 1â€“6 wires. Each group corresponded to an input wire for the next bank of rotors.
    </li>
    <li>

      The third bank of rotors was called the index rotors. These rotors were smaller, with only ten contacts, and did not step during the encryption. After travelling though the index rotors, one to four of five output lines would have power. These
      then turned the cypher rotors.
    </li>

  </ul>
